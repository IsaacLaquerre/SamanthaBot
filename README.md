# SamanthaBot
If you intend to clone this repo and host this bot yourself, please change the following configurations inside the `botConfig.json` file located in the [config folder](/config)

```json
{
  "prefix": "Change this to the prefered prefix",
  "token": "Change this to your application's token"
}
```

The `token` key should be replaced with [your Discord application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)'s token

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to host this bot on your computer/box. Once installed, open the cloned folder and press `SHIFT + Right Click` and click on "Open PowerShell window here". Once the PowerShell window opened, simply insert `Node .` and you'll be ready to go.
